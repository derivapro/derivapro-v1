### Purpose

* Design and develop a web-based dashboard with user-friendly options for derivatives selection, validation sets, and reporting.  
* Implement a suite of model valuation (i.e., Option Net Present Value) and risk management (e.g., Sensitivity or Risk-based P&L analyses) in the backend, coupled with an API manager to handle a Generative API (e.g., ChatGPT API) interactions.  
* Incorporate a back-end Market Data API that provides the input data into the derivatives pricing model.  
* Integrate the API to generate AI-driven interpretations and insights based on our analysis results.  
* Ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations throughout the development process.

### Overview

The QDPTB allows users to price a variety of derivatives using real-time market data.
The program allows for customization of several factors, including the underlying
derivative pricing method itself. For any derivative and pricing method chosen by
the user, Net Present Value, relevant Greeks, and visualizations are provided.
Specific toolbox functionalities for different derivative types can be found in
more detail within the [How To Guide](#How-To-Guide).
